Most component templating is done using [JSViews](https://www.jsviews.com/#jsviews). JSViews, like jQuery, is typically included separate from the component bundle.  So we will add it to our examples/index.html like so:

```
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jsviews/0.9.76/jsviews.min.js"></script>
```
