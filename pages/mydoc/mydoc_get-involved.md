You don't need permission to get involved with ViewDir as a developer, designer, tester, documenter, or anything else.  Get in touch!  We would love for you to help out with this documentation, please make a pull request. You may find the [Jekyll Theme documentation helpful](http://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/).  General thoughts and feedback on Viewdir can be submitted as issues to our [NOTES repository](https://github.com/viewdir/notes).

## We're Not Done
This documentation will continue to evolve along with the corresponding tools and techniques. We plan to continue publishing updates to keep the contents current. We also intend this to be a DRY approach, so if better documentation exists elsewhere (say a component repository), we will link to that, rather than recreate it here.

## Additional Resources

* [Web Components Best Practices](http://webcomponents.org/articles/web-components-best-practices/)

## Feedback
We understand the need to keep our documentation up to date. If there was anything that was unclear, incorrect, missing, or could be improved on the book itself, we want to hear about it from you. The best way to issue feedback is to [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/viewdir/viewdir.github.io/issues/new) so one of the authors can address it.
