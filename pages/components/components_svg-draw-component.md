svg-draw-component ([example](http://viewdir.github.io/svg-draw-component/examples/)) allows you to draw SVG shapes on HTML5 canvases (using [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/)), and can be used as an overlay on top of images, deep zoom interfaces, and beyond.  This component simply publishes events as shapes are added, modified, and removed from the canvas.  The events contain information that other components (i.e. an annotator or animator component) might find useful.  Hence, the svg-draw-component is useful outside the IIIF context, but it takes the needs of IIIF's approach to annotations into consideration when publishing events.
