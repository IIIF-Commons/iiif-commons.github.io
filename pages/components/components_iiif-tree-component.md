[https://github.com/viewdir/iiif-tree-component](https://github.com/viewdir/iiif-tree-component)

iiif-tree-component ([example](http://viewdir.github.io/iiif-tree-component/examples/)) was the first component to be written for the [Universal Viewer](http://universalviewer.io/examples) and comprises the tree menu functionality inside the “index” tab in the left-hand-side panel.

This uses Manifold’s support for date sorting and lazy loading to populate the menu.
